# Zatsuma : Zcash Point-Of-Sale

My imaginary use case was a market stall selling vegetables, the owner wants his customers to pay with crypto but doesn't trust his sales people with access to his wallet. It would also work well for a bar, a shop, girl-scouts selling cookies, anywhere that sales are made face to face.

Another important feature was that there should be no 'middle-men' or service that processes transactions, all funds
received must be go directly to the shop wallet. No service fees, no commission charges, no vulnerable central point.

The salesperson uses it on their phone, which connects to a server (ie: a laptop) that the owner leaves running at home. It does simple order processing, checks for payments received & a few other things, but as it can ONLY receive funds the shop owner doesn't have to trust anyone.

Here's a summary of what it does :-

- No hosting required, uses dynamic DNS
- Sales staff use their own phone, tablet or browser
- No intermediaries, funds go directly to the owners wallet
- Orders are created in FIAT amount, almost all 'fiat-forks' (USD/EUR/CLP/etc) are supported
- The customer scans a payment QRcode with their wallet
- Simple messaging between sales staff
- Can receive feedback from customers via memos (ie: visitors book, tips, etc)
- Designed for Zcash (ZEC), both transparent and SHIELDED payments
  ...also supports Bitcoin (BTC) via on-chain or Lightning Network
